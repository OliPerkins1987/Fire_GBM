# Fire_GBM
Code for development of a global behavioural model of human fire impacts. Supports paper (Perkins et al., 2021) under submission to Socio-ecological simulation modelling (SESMO). 

Code in this repository was used to define simple classification tree models to define the distribution of 'land fire systems'. 

The code to combine the outputs of these tree models into a single simulation now forms a part of the Wildfire Human Agency model. That repository can be found at:
